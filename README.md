### Tito-s-Profile

### Motivation

* The motivation for making this project is my desire to become a successful full stack web developer. I want this profile to highlight everything that I will be able to do by the time I leave bootcamp and venture on to my next project. As I progress through the course, I will be adding as many projects and pictures as possible. I want this profile to be a showcase of my coding abilities, as I hope it is at this current point in time. It is imporant for me to make a good impression for any potential employers/work partners that may be looking for a new prospect. 

### Features

* This website does not have much in terms of features. Rather this site is designed to be an informative depiction of myself. It may in the future have some features that showcase my abilities. In the meantime, this website will just serve as information for potential employers. For now, it only has functional buttons on the navbar that highlight which page you are on. It also has a section where you can fill out some of your own contact information so that I can get back to you, although it is not functional yet.

### Build Status

* This build is currently in very early Alpha. As I progress through the course and I expand my coding knowledge, I will be putting all that knowledge towards this project.
