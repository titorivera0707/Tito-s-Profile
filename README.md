### Tito-s-Profile

### Motivation

* The motivation for making this project is my desire to become a successful full stack web developer. I want this profile to highlight everything that I will be able to do by the time I leave bootcamp and venture on to my next project. As I progress through the course, I will be adding as many projects and pictures as possible. It is imporant for me to make a good impression for any potential employers/work partners that may be looking for a new prospect. 

### Build Status

* This build is currently in very early Alpha. As I progress through the course and I expand my coding knowledge, I will be putting all that knowledge towards this project.
